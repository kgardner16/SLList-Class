# SLList-Class
This is the code for the first type of Abstract Data Structure that I learned how to implement: Singly Linked Lists.

SLList.h defines a template class called SLList that allows the user to create lists of variables of any type: int, char, string, etc. Because SLList uses dynamic memory, it is advantageous to use when creating a list, especially as opposed to a static array, because new nodes of the list can be added/removed whenever necessary, via member functions like addFirst() or removeFirst(). 

Usage: 
SLList.h contains the class declaration and implementation, and main.cpp includes a few sample test cases to illustrate how the member functions of SLList work.
